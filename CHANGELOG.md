## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `pydrex.update_all` to update texture of multiphase aggregates simultaneously
- `get_regime` argument to `update_all`/`update_orientations` to allow for
  temporally variable deformation regimes
- Texture evolution for diffusion creep and yielding regimes (experimental)
- Functions to get peridotite solidus and second order tensor invariants
- Terse SCSV schema parser (only for Python >= 3.12)
- Ability to toggle verbose doctest output using `pytest -vv`

### Changed
- Call signature for steady flow 2D box visualisation function
- Symbol names for default stiffness tensors (now members of
  `minerals.StiffnessTensors` â€” use your own preferred stiffness tensors by
  passing a custom instance when e.g. calculating Voigt averages)

### Fixed
- Handling of enstatite in Voigt averaging
